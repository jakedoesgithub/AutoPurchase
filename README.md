<h1> AutoPurchase </h1>
A python program to check for when an item is in stock then send an alert or purchase that item.

You will need to create a file called env.py in which you will define variables you want to keep hidden.
Examples include:
SID and TOKEN for your Twillio sid and auth_token respectivly.
various cell phone numbers
username and password for bestbuy, newegg, etc
credit card info

I've left the imports and the static variables imported from the env.py file at the top of main.py
so it shouldn't be hard to just copy the variable names I've used and fill in your own information.
I'll try to remember to write up a sample env.py called sample_env.py when I am finished to make it
easier on whoever decides to use this.
